# RomCom

RomCom is an application that allows the user to generate random romance novel covers from pre-set data, or input their own image, title, and descriptors to create their own.

## Usage 

When you visit the RomCom site, a randomly generated cover will display.  When you refresh the page a new random book cover will display.  If you like a cover that you see you can click the "Save Cover" button and the cover will be saved for you to look at later.  If you would like to create your own book cover you can click the "Make Your Own Cover" button which will take you to a form that allows you to input your own image url, title, and two descrptive words.  When you click the "Make My Book" button, the home page will display with your custom created cover.  This cover is also able to be saved.  When you click on the "Show Saved Covers" button you will be re-directed to a page that displays all of your covers.  If you decide that you no longer want to see a cover, a simple double clicking of the cover image will delete the book cover from your view.  

## Technology Used 

RomCom uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
